# resolvent_minimal
Minimal files (in MATLAB) for consistent Koopman approximation via resolvent compactification, to be used with [NLSA](https://github.com/dg227/NLSA). These correspond to [_Consistent spectral approximation of Koopman operators using resolvent compactification_, arXiv:2309.00732](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00732). 

Files should work with examples of the same name in the NLSA examples directory. A plotting file is included for both the l63 system and the rossler system, which should match conventions in the paper. Run either example by navigating into the directory and running the "driver" file.

Questions and bug reports welcome â€” email me :)
